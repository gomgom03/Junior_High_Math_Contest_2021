Find the smallest positive integer $k$ for which the expression $$\sqrt{20+\sqrt{19+\sqrt{18+k}}}$$ is an integer.
Rank the following variables from least to greatest: $a = 2^{(3^5)}, b = 5^{(3^2)}, c = 3^{(2^5)}, d = 3^{(5^2)}$. For your answer, submit the letters with no spaces (i.e. $abcd$).

We say a number is 'happy' if all of its digits are perfect squares. How many positive integers less than or equal $100,000$ are happy?
John is playing a game.  He starts with the number $-1/2$, and he has four “operation tokens” to perform mathematical operations on his number.  For each token, he can either add 2, multiply by 2, or square his current number (for example, $+2, \times2, +2,\ ^\wedge 2$, would produce 25).  John wants to end with an integer-- what is the largest possible integer that John can end up with after using all four tokens?
Fred takes 6 hours to clean a car. Charles takes 2 hours to clean a car. Amelia takes 1 hour to clean a car. Working together, how many <strong>minutes</strong> does it take Fred, Charles, and Amelia together to clean a car?
What is the maximum number of chess pieces that can be placed on an $8\times8$ chess board such that no two pieces occupy the same diagonal?  
Compute the smallest prime $p$ such that $p+6$ is prime but $p+1,p+2,\ldots,p+5$ are all composite.
The three lines below enclose a triangular region. Find the area of this region. $$y=-\tfrac{3}{5}x+3\\$$ $$y=-3x-5\\$$ $$y=-2$$
How many ways are there to place an ``X” and an ``O” on a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board such that they are adjacent over an edge (so diagonals don't count)?  
100 people sit in a circle, and are each given a label $1,2,3,\ldots,100$.  A random integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, is chosen, and all people with labels divisible by this number are removed from the circle.  What is the probability that the person labelled ``75” leaves, but the person labelled ``25” stays? 
Joe has a square pool in his backyard. His parents want to build a walkway to surround the pool. They want this walkway to have rounded corners so that it is 5 feet wide at all points. They measured the pool and discovered its diagonal length to be 18 feet. The area of the walkway is in the form $a\sqrt2+b\pi$ square feet, for positive integers $a,b$. What is $a+b?$
What is the area of the region enclosed by the graph of $\vert2x\vert + \vert y - 2021\vert = 4$?
Find the minimum value of $4^{x+1}-2^{x-1}+1$ over all real numbers $x$.
A square with side length 7 and and a circle with radius 4 have the same center. The exact value of the black area minus the gray area can be written in the form $a\pi+b$ for rational numbers $a$ and $b$. Find $a+b.$<br><img src="weirdimg.png" style="width:20%;height:auto;">
For each integer $N$ between 1 and $1,000,000$, inclusive, Tom writes down the largest factor of $N$ that is a perfect cube. Find the sum of all of the numbers he wrote down.

Consider the first 30,000 terms of the Fibonacci sequence: $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots$ where each number is the sum of the previous two terms.  How many of these terms will be divisible by 3?
Given that $a,b$ are real numbers such that $a - b =ab=6$, find $(a+b)^2$.
A person surveys 138 people on their tastes of music. 65 people answered that they liked both kpop and pop, 60 people in total said they didn't like pop, and 99 people in total said they liked kpop. Assuming kpop and pop were the only choices of music provided, what fraction of the people surveyed liked pop but not kpop?
Every day, Martin runs directly north from his house and returns on the same path traveling south, and his goal to run twice as far as the previous day. On day 1, Martin runs $\frac14$th of a mile (so he runs $\frac18$th of a mile north and $\frac18$th of a mile south). On day 8, he collapses of exhaustion after running $\frac58$ths of his goal for the day. A hospital is located 35 miles directly east of Martin’s house. A helicopter flies the fastest route from the hospital to pick up Martin from where he fell (assuming no obstacles in the sky), and then flies the same route back to the hospital. How far, in miles, did the helicopter travel?
Noah and Iron Man are playing a game. They take turns each writing one digit (0-9) from left to right, forming a number with $n$ total digits (the first digit cannot be 0, and digits can be repeated), where $n$ is some positive integer. Noah wins if the final number is divisible by 3; otherwise, Iron Man wins. If Noah goes first, and both players play perfectly, find the sum of all positive integers $n\le 20$ for which Noah will win.
Ronald chooses 5 real numbers at random each between 0 and 1, and writes them down in a line. What is the probability that he writes them in either increasing or decreasing order, from left to right?
A deck with 12 cards, numbered $1$, $2$, $3 \dots$  $12$, is shuffled.  Abby and Brandon each randomly draw and keep two of the cards, without any replacement.  What is the probability that Abby’s lowest card is higher than Brandon’s highest card?
A certain math competition is scored as follows: Before the competition, the coach selects 5 students from the team as CONTESTANTS, and the rest are considered ALTERNATES. The sum of the top 3 scores out of the contestants forms the team score (the other 2 scores are ignored). At the competition, 7 students from the team took the contest, and suppose the coach chose the 5 contestants from these 7 at random. If exactly 4 students (not necessarily contestants) got perfect scores, what is the probability the team did <strong>not</strong> get a perfect score?
Frankenstein is thinking of a number.  He gives you the following clues:  <ul><li>The number is a four digit positive integer (no leading zeros). </li> <li>When rounded to the nearest hundred, the number increases.</li> <li>The thousands place is the product of the units place and the tens place.</li> <li>The number is divisible by 11.</li><li>When the number is flipped (i.e. $1234\rightarrow4321$), it is divisible by 6.</li></ul> What is Frankenstein’s number?
If the sum $$\frac{1}{\sqrt0+\sqrt2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt1+\sqrt3}+\frac{1}{\sqrt2+\sqrt4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{\sqrt{99}+\sqrt{101}}$$ can be written in simplest form as $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a,b,c$ are positive integers, find $a+b+c$.
How many blueberries of radius 1 can you fit in a $16\times16\times2$ box if we assume blueberries are perfect spheres? Submit a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. If your number is less than or equal to the mean of all (valid) answers submitted, you will receive that many points.
