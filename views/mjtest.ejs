    \begin{problem}
    John is playing a game. He starts with the number $-1/2$, and he has four “operation tokens” to perform mathematical
    operations on his number. For each token, he can either add 2, multiply by 2, or square his current number (for

    A person surveys 138 people on their tastes of music. 65 people answered that they liked both kpop and pop, 60
    people in total said they didn't like pop, and 99 people in total said they liked kpop. Assuming kpop and pop were

    \begin{problem}
    Every day, Martin runs directly north from his house and returns on the same path traveling south, and his goal to
    run twice as far as the previous day. On day 1, Martin runs $\frac14$th of a mile (so he runs $\frac18$th of a mile
    north and $\frac18$th of a mile south). On day 8, he collapses of exhaustion after running $\frac58$ths of his goal
    for the day. A hospital is located 35 miles directly east of Martin’s house. A helicopter flies the fastest route
    from the hospital to pick up Martin from where he fell (assuming no obstacles in the sky), and then flies the same
    route back to the hospital. How far, in miles, did the helicopter travel?
    \end{problem}

    \begin{problem}
    Noah and Iron Man are playing a game. They take turns each writing one digit (0-9) from left to right, forming a
    number with $n$ total digits (the first digit cannot be 0, and digits can be repeated), where $n$ is some positive
    integer. Noah wins if the final number is divisible by 3; otherwise, Iron Man wins. If Noah goes first, and both
    players play perfectly, find the sum of all positive integers $n\le 20$ for which Noah will win.

    Frankenstein is thinking of a number. He gives you the following clues:

    \item The number is a four digit positive integer (no leading zeros).
    \item When rounded to the nearest hundred, the number increases.
    \item The thousands place is the product of the units place and the tens place.
    \item The number is divisible by 11.
    \item When the number is flipped (i.e. $1234\rightarrow4321$), it is divisible by 6.
